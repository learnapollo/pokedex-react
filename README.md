## Getting started

If you haven't done it already, checkout the [hands-on Learn Apollo tutorial](https://learnapollo.com/).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:learnapollo/pokedex-react.git
cd pokedex-react
cd exercise-01
yarn install
yarn start # open localhost:3000
```

## Workflow

As you're following along the Learn Apollo tutorial, you will work on different coding excercises. Each exercise has a folder that you can use to start working and a solution folder where you can take a peek if the instructions given on Learn Apollo are not clear enough.

After you completed the step, you can compare your results to the official solution by looking into the respective folder. If you found a different solution than we're proposing, feel free to [tell us](http://slack.graph.cool/) about your solution. 💡
